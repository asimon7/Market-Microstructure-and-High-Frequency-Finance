# Market-Microstructure-and-High-Frequency-Finance
The project was a part of final grade for the Market Microstructure and High Frequency Finance course at Unibo in 2021/22.

Wit my colleague we recreated results from the paper: “Dynamic Trading with Predictable Returns and Transaction Costs” written by NICOLAE GARLEANU and LASSE HEJE PEDERSEN. In the article, the authors present a strategy called Optimal which reduces trading costs (transactions and risk cost) when security returns are predictable by signals with different mean-reversion speeds. The Optimal strategy is characterized by two principles: (1) aim in front of the target, and (2) trade partially toward the current aim. 

We implemented the optimal strategy for WIG20 futures.
